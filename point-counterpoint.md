## Introduction

What if [konu] has more negative effects than we realize? Today, many people think that [konu] is helpful because it [olumlu yön]. They believe it brings benefits such as [fayda 1] and [fayda 2].  
However, others argue that [konu] causes serious problems. In my opinion, [konu] is more harmful than beneficial because it leads to [zararlı sonuç 1] and [zararlı sonuç 2].

## Body Paragraph 1

Some people support [konu] because they think it helps individuals in many ways. For example, they say it improves [alan], allows [özgürlük veya gelişim türü], and gives people more choices. [Etkinlik veya araştırma örneği] shows how people enjoy the advantages of [konu].  

However, this positive image does not tell the whole story. [Konu] also causes [negatif sonuç], which has a long-term effect on [toplum/çevre/ilişkiler]. For instance, [örnek olay/istatistik]. This means that the benefits of [konu] are often temporary, but the problems can last much longer.

## Body Paragraph 2

Supporters also argue that [konu] helps the economy or society by [ekonomik/sosyal katkı]. In countries like [ülke], it creates job opportunities and increases income for many people. These benefits seem very important, especially for poor communities.  

Yet, many of these jobs are not safe or fair. Workers often face poor conditions and low salaries. A study by [kurum veya kaynak] showed that [olumsuz istatistik veya örnek]. So even though [konu] may help the economy, it often hurts the people who are involved. This makes the benefit less meaningful.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, although [konu] has some advantages, its negative effects are more serious and long-lasting. It causes harm to [çevre, insanlar, toplum] and creates risks that should not be ignored.  
I believe we need to limit the harmful effects of [konu] by using better rules and more responsible behavior. If we take action now, we can find a better balance in the future.
