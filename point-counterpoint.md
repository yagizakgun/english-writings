# [Konu Başlığı]

## Introduction

What if [konu] has more negative effects than we realize? Some people think it brings benefits such as [olumlu yön]. However, others say it causes serious problems. I believe that [konu] does more harm than good because of [negatif nedenler].

## Body Paragraph 1

Some people believe that [konu] is helpful because it [olumlu yön]. For example, they say it supports [alan] and helps people with [fayda]. Events like [etkinlik örneği] show the positive side of it.  
However, this positive view hides some serious problems. [Olumsuz sonuç] shows that [konu] causes damage to [alan/çevre/insanlar]. For instance, [örnek veya istatistik] proves that it is not always beneficial.

## Body Paragraph 2

Others also argue that [konu] creates opportunities, especially in [ülke/sektör]. It is true that it gives people jobs or helps the economy. For example, in [ülke], [istatistik veya bilgi].  
Yet, many of these jobs are unfair or unsafe. People often work in bad conditions and earn very little money. A report shows that [olumsuz gerçek]. So, even though it seems helpful, the problems it causes are more serious.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, although [konu] has some benefits, the negative effects are much greater. It harms [çevre, insanlar, toplum] and creates many risks. I believe strong rules and better practices are necessary to reduce the damage and find a better balance.
